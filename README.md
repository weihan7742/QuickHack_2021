# QuickHack_2021
### Instructions
1. pip install pillow, kivy, kivmd, numpy
2. install python version >= 3.6
3. run command "pip install opencv-contrib-python --upgrade"
4. run "main.py"

### Theme Selected
1. Mental Health

### Project background
1.  Alzheimerâ€™s is a neurological disease likely caused by inability of brain cells to function leading to irreversible loss of neurons and thus brain damage. It is the most common type of dementia-- often affecting the older population.
2. Worldwide, at least 50 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. According to the United Nations, that is more than the population of Columbia. If breakthroughs are not discovered, rates could exceed 152 million by 2050.
4. Approximately, up to 40% of people with Alzheimer's disease suffer from significant depression and the accompanying memory loss can cause anxiety and agitation.
5. This causes a significant impact on the mental health of Alzheimer's patients and can reduce the quality of their lives in a negative manner. 
6. In an effort to help, we came up with *iKnowU*, which is a mobile app with a user-friendly UI created to aid people struggling with early stages of dementia in recognizing their loved ones.

### Notes
If the app can't run "Train" function and the facial recognition function, can consider: 

1. Running "train_faces.py"
2. Running "opencv_cam.py" to demonstrate the facial recognition

If the facial recognition works in the app, there might be a bug which causes infinite recursion. In that case, please delete the process from the Task Manager.
